# CRUD-Operations-for-Product-Database-Using-Mongoose.
Create a Node.js application that connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. Define a Product model with properties such as name, price, and category. Implement routes or functions to perform CRUD operations: add a new product, retrieve all products, update a product by its ID, and delete a product by its ID.
